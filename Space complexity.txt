📘 SPACE COMPLEXITY

🔹 Definition

Space Complexity measures the extra (auxiliary) memory an algorithm uses apart from the input data.
It includes all temporary storage, variables, function calls, and recursion stack used while running the code.

🔹 Why It Matters

Efficient code isn’t just fast, it’s also memory-friendly.
If an algorithm consumes too much memory, it may slow down or crash on large inputs — even if its time complexity is good.

🔹 Representations

🟩 O(1) → Constant Space
Uses a fixed amount of memory, no matter how large the input is.

🟦 O(n) → Linear Space
Memory usage grows linearly with the size of input.

🟥 O(n²) → Quadratic Space
Memory usage grows rapidly when data is stored in nested structures (like 2D arrays or matrix copies).

🔹 Example
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for i in arr:
    print(i)       # O(1) → No extra data stored

new_arr = arr.copy()  # O(n) → Copying requires extra space equal to input

🔹 Auxiliary Space Includes

Temporary variables

Function call memory

Recursion stack

Extra data structures (arrays, lists, hash maps, etc.)

🔹 Real-World Analogy
Complexity	Example
O(1)	One notebook for all subjects 📘
O(n)	One notebook per subject 📚
O(n²)	Notes inside each notebook 😅
🔹 Key Takeaways

✅ Space complexity = Extra memory required by the algorithm
✅ Less space → better efficiency and scalability
✅ Write code that’s both fast and memory-light 💾
